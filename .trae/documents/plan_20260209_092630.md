The error `Unexpected socket close` is caused by a mismatch between the SMTP port and the security settings in `src/emailService.js`.

**The Problem:**
- Your `.env` file uses **Port 465** (standard for SSL).
- Your `src/emailService.js` has `secure: false` hardcoded.
- **Port 465** requires `secure: true`. Connecting without it causes the server to close the connection immediately.

**The Fix:**
I will modify `src/emailService.js` to automatically set `secure: true` when the port is 465.

**Steps:**
1.  Edit `src/emailService.js`:
    - Change the `secure` property in `nodemailer.createTransport` configuration.
    - It will be set dynamically: `secure: process.env.SMTP_PORT == 465`.

This will resolve the socket error and allow emails to be sent using your Gmail configuration.
